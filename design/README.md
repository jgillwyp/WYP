# WYP — Design

Static HTML mockups for every app screen, in palette 1. These are the design
source of truth: a screen is designed here first, reviewed here, then converted
to a React component under `app/`.

**This folder is not served.** It sits outside `public/`, so nothing here is
reachable from the live Vercel URL. It is also in `tsconfig.json`'s `exclude`
list, so nothing here is typechecked or can break a build.

## Folders

| Folder | Holds |
|---|---|
| `screens/` | Canonical, approved mockup for each screen — one file per screen |
| `drafts/` | Variants under discussion, and superseded work kept for reference |
| `spec/` | The UI spec the `§` comments in each mockup refer to |

## Screen map

| Screen | Mockup | Route | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main (Requests + ToDos) | `screens/WYP_main_screen_palette1.html` | `/` | Mockup |
| Start my Free Account / Sign In | `screens/WYP_signin_palette1_floating.html` | `/login` | Converted, **needs update** (React page lacks the two modes) |
| Create my Free Account — first run | `screens/WYP_create_free_account_palette1.html` | `/account/new` | Mockup |
| Your Account — returning | `screens/WYP_your_account_palette1_floating.html` | `/account` | Mockup |
| Add Contact | `screens/WYP_add_contact_palette1_floating.html` | `/contacts/new` | Mockup |
| Respond to Request | — | `/r/[token]` | Design pending |

## Sign-up flow

There is no sign-up screen, because `signInWithOtp` creates the account on first
use and cannot tell whether the address already exists. Both entry points make
the identical call; they differ only in wording, and the paths diverge *after*
the link is clicked, based on whether the user has a profile row yet.

```
sales page ──→ "Start my Free Account" ─┐
                                        ├─→ email sent ─→ [link] ─→ /auth/callback
returning  ──→ "Sign In" ───────────────┘                              │
                                                  profile row? ──no──→ Create my Free Account ──→ main
                                                        │
                                                       yes ─────────────────────────────────────→ main
```

Band label, form caption, and the confirmation line all change with the mode —
three strings, one screen. Only the join path mentions Create my Free Account,
because only the join path leads there.

Recipients reach the same funnel from the "Create your own Free Account" block
on Respond to Request.

Two rules fall out of this, both settled 2026-08-02:

- **First run shows Save only.** No Cancel, no Sign out. The user is
  authenticated but has no profile row, so an exit at that moment leaves an auth
  user who owns nothing and lands back on the same screen next time.
- **First run suppresses the subscription banner and ad slot.** An upsell and an
  ad before the person has seen the product is a poor first impression. Both
  appear on every screen after this one.

Status values: **Mockup** (design only) → **Converted** (React component exists)
→ **Live** (deployed and wired to real data).

## Conventions

**Naming:** `WYP_<screen>_palette<N>[_variant].html`

**One canonical file per screen.** Git holds the history — do not keep
`_old` / `_retired_<date>` copies alongside the current one. A retired `.tsx`
copy with a paste error inside `app/` broke the build on 2026-08-02; that is
the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.

**Self-contained files.** Images are embedded as data URIs and the only
external reference is the Inter webfont, so a mockup can be opened directly
from disk with no build step and no missing assets.

**Tokens are copied, not invented.** The `:root` block in every mockup must
match `app/globals.css`. When a mockup needs a component the system does not
have, add it with a `PROPOSED` comment and a `§` number so it can be folded
into the spec deliberately.

## Proposed components awaiting spec entry

| Class | Purpose | First used |
|---|---|---|
| `.btn-block` | Full-width primary action for auth screens, which have no band cluster | Sign In |
| `.checkrow` | Single persistent toggle; chips only cover either/or choices | Sign In |
| `.finput[readonly]` + `--locked` | Read-only field, for the email that is also the sign-in ID | Your Account |
| `.btn-quiet` | Global action that must stay reachable without competing with Create | Main screen — Log Out |

## Notes

`drafts/WYP_requests_partial_SUPERSEDED.html` was built from a partial
screenshot before the full main screen existed. It shows only one Sent card and
no ToDos section. Kept only to explain the Log Out placement discussion; use
`screens/WYP_main_screen_palette1.html` instead.
